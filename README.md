# UFOs

## Overview
This projects purpose was to create a webiste that documents and filters UFO Sightings utilizing Javascript, HTML, & CSS.

## Results
There is a lot of UFO data being pulled into the site (so much that no one in their right mind would want to go thorough it). By expanding the filters to include Date, City, State, County, and UFO Shape, anyone visiting the site can easily parse through the data to find exactly what they may be looking for.

## Summary
This site is great for the specific purpose of looking through the data.  There are a few rooms for improvement thought.  On the data side, it is hard to tell the true validitity of each datapoint.  As well, the imput for the user is a bit restrictive to exactly how the data is shown (for example, ca for California instead of CA). Either the data could be updated, or the code for the sight could have the useres imputs set to automatically be lower case.
